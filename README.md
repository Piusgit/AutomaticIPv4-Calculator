Welcome to the Automatic IPv4 Calculator, powerful Python application that automates IPv4 subnetting fopr both Fixed Length Subnet Masking(FLSM) and Variable Length Subnet Masking(VLSM) scenarios.
This GUI application, built with customtkinter, provides a user-friendly interface for quick and precise IPv4 address calculations. You can also find the python script in this repository, allowing you
to reuse and modify the code for your own projects...



## **Features** 

-**Automated subnetting:** Effortlessly calculate subnet addresses, broadcast addresses and usable ranges with just a few clicks.
The Automatic IPv4 Calculator takes care of the complex calculations for you and all is done without internet connection.
The internet connection is only needed when you want to perform reverse DNS for an ip address incase you want to be sure of the the domain name related to the ip address and also
for sending your feedback or issues on the applicattion.

-**FLSM and VLSM Support:** Whether you're working with Fixed Length Subnet Mask or Variable Length Subnet Mask, this application has got you covered!

-**Copy Functionality:** Easily copy calcu;ated results to your clipboard for quick and  convenient use in other applications.

-**Feedback and Support:** Your feedback is valuable! If you encounter any issues, have questions, or want to suggest improvements, please open an issue on the feedback feature.
Your input helps to enhance the application

     - On linux: Run the autoipv4 file.
  
4. **Explore the GUI**
     - You will be greeted by the Automatic IPv4 Calculator's intuitive and customizable GUi.
     - Check help button or input your desired IP addresses and subnet mask in CIDR notation (/24)
     - Switch between the tabs of SUBNET CALCULATOR or VLSM CALCULATOR based on your requirements.

5. **Calculate Subnets**
     - Click calculate button and let the calculator generate subnetting information for you!
     - The results will be displayed on the GUI.
  
6. **Copy and Reuse**
     - If you want to use the calculated information in other applications, simply click the copy button. The data will be copied for easy pasting.
  





   **Python Script for customization**

   To explore and customize the pythonautoipv4.py that contains the logic for subnetting calculations, allowing you to
   adapt it for your specific needs or integrate it into other projects. Feel free to fork this repository and experiment with the code. and also you cann credit me if you don't mind.


## **Feedback and Contributions**

I believe in the power of collaboration. If you have ideas for improvements, find bugs, or want to contribute to the project, please open an issue or submit a pull request on the
