## **Features** 

-**Automated subnetting:** Effortlessly calculate subnet addresses, broadcast addresses and usable ranges with just a few clicks.
_The Automatic IPv4 Calculator takes care of the complex calculations for you and all is done without internet connection._
_Need internet for reverse-dns-lookup & providing a feeedback._

-**FLSM and VLSM Support:** Well this cool, right?

-**Copy Functionality:** Easily copy to clipboard.

-**Feedback and Support:** This is valuable for issues and suggestions









## **Usage**
1. **Download and Install**
   - To get started, **download the zip file** and install it on your pc, it comes with all the dependencies no need of additional files to run it. 
   - Or **install with git clone** available for windows platform so far but you can reuse the python file with other OS(Mac, Linux).    
    Open a terminal in your desired directory and run:
```
git clone https://github.com/douglascybersec/AutomaticIPv4-Calculator.git

```
_PS: You must have ['git'](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed on windows_
      


3. **Run the Appliction**
     - Open the extracted folder and locate the main executable file.
     - Double-click the autoipv4.exe file with an icon.
       
  
4. **Explore the GUI**
     - You will be greeted by the Automatic IPv4 Calculator's intuitive and customizable GUi.
     - Check help button or input your desired IP addresses and subnet mask in CIDR notation (/24)
     - Switch between the tabs of SUBNET CALCULATOR or VLSM CALCULATOR based on your requirements.

5. **Calculate Subnets**
     - Click calculate button and let the calculator generate subnetting information for you!
     - The results will be displayed on the GUI.
  
6. **Copy and Reuse**
     - If you want to use the calculated information in other applications, simply click the copy button. The data will be copied for easy pasting.
  





   **Python Script for customization**

   To explore and customize the code use the python file **autoipv4.py** that contains the logic for subnetting calculations, allowing you to
   adapt it for your specific needs or integrate it into other projects. Feel free to fork this repository and experiment with the code. and also you can credit me if you don't mind.


## **Feedback and Contributions**
I believe in the power of collaboration. If you have ideas for improvements, find bugs, or want to contribute to the project, please open an issue or submit a pull request on the
GitHub repository. you can also use the application to send me a feedback. I will definitely receive it and get back to you. Your feedback and contributions are highly apprreciated and 
help make this handy tool for Network designers even better.
